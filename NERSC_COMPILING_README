Building the code on edison or cori-haswell with Intel or gnu compilers

Make sure you are using the correct programming environment 
(type module list to see, and if you need to switch, 
use, e.g., "module swap PrgEnv-gnu PrgEnv-intel")

Make sure your copies of FluctHydro and FBoxLib are at the same level in 
your filesystem.  Pull both codes on the master branch.

>> module load cray-fftw (or put this in your shell script)

>> cd ./FluctHydro/staggered_grid/src_multiSpec/LAPACK95

>> make clean

>> make (don't use -j here)

>> cd ./FluctHydro/staggered_grid/exec/multiSpecLM_implicit/test 
(or whatever directory you want to compile)

Edit the GNUmakefile as follows:

COMP      := Intel
CCOMP     := Intel

or

COMP      := gfortran
CCOMP     := gcc

>> make -j8
