1/30/12 Checked in the convergence tests for the incompressible mode with BCs (inputs_type11_2d) 
        and ABC flow with forced tracer (inputs_type2_3d). They both converge at 2nd order accuracy. 
        More details are contained in Log.Andy.

2/23/12 I did some preliminary timing tests. I ran 1000 steps of the algorithm using 
        dt = 0.1 on a 256^2 grid with 8 processors. This took around 2 minutes, 10 seconds 
        with the ibamr code, and 2 minutes, 30 seconds with the BoxLib code. 

2/29/12 Checked that <c c> and velocity trace spectra converge to 2nd order in time in 2D.

3/1/12 I compared the variance.vtk files to ibamr code. There was no noticeable difference
       for the vx-vx, vy-vy, vx-vy, and c-c variances. I did this both with hard walls 
       in one direction, and with hard walls in both directions.

3/20/12 I checked the spectrum for a 3D run with hard walls. The plot looked qualitatively
        reasonable, with no changes near walls or corners.

10/10/12 Convergence of fluctuations in time, results below (uncertainty small 
         compared to error unless noted)
