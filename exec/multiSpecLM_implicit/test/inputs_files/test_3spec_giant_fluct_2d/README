 - Figure 3 (Section III.C.2)
in Paper by Donev et al.
 "Low Mach number fluctuating hydrodynamics of multispecies liquid mixtures"
 Phys. Fluids 27, 037103 (2015)

Scripts are based on inputs file ../inputs_paper_3spec_giant_fluct_2d 

** Execution
- edit run.sh and run it
- move to $RUNNAME directory and "gnuplot ../Sk.plt"
  (make sure the right values of nu, c11, c12, c22 are chosen)
  (values of c11, c12, c22 are for smaller system 64x32)
