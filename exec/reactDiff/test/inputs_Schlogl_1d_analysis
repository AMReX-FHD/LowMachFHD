! This inputs file calculates the structure factor S(k) of 1d monomodal Schlogl model.
! For the analysis, see "test/misc/Schlog_1d_analysis" directory.
!
! For the reaction model and parameter values, see "Chemical reactions" part below.
! For the rate constants k1 = 1.5, k2 = 0.6, k3 = 2.05, k4 = 2.95,
! nb = 1, r = -d'(nb) = 1.75, D0 = DG(nb) = 3.55.
! 
! The use of unitless numbers is convenient for the analysis.
! alpha = r*dt
! beta = D_Fick*dt/dx/dx
! You may find that by changing rate_multiplier and D_Fick, the values of alpha and beta
! can be independently changed, respectively.
