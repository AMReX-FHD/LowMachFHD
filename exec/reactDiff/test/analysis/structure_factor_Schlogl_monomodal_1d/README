by running run.sh,
1) inputs_Schlogl_monomodal_1d is excuted with modified options given in run.sh;
2) Sk_xi.py is executed to generate res.Sk_xi from Schlogl.S_k.pair=1.Re.dat.

res.Sk_xi contains three columns:
1st=xi (unitless variable corresponding to k; see info_Schlogl_monomodal_1d)
2st=calculated structure factor Sk(xi)
3rd=exact structure factor

theoretical values of Sk(xi) can be obtained from mathematica notebook structure_factor_analysis.nb
(some results are in subdirectory theo_data for code validation purpose)
