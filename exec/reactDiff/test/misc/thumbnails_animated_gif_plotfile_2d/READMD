This is a tool for generating an animated gif having thumbnails, 
each of which contains a set of 2d plotfiles.

"src_python" directory contains python scripts for this function.

"example_2x2" directory contains bash scripts, which demonstrate
how an animated gif file is generated.

For example run, simply execute the following three scripts:
  0_generate_plotfiles_example.sh
  1_generate_animated_gif.sh
  2_annotate_afterwards.sh
Then, two gif files (1.gif, 2.gif) will be generated.

If you want to change margins, plotsize etc.,
modify "input_thumbnails_info.py".
