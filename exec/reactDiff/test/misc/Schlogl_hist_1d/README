how to run: first, execute run.sh
            then, execute stat.sh (for NRUN>1)


1. run.sh

If NRUN>1, several runs are performed with different random seeds.
(if USEMPIEXEC=yes, these runs are concurrently performed by mpiexec.)

For each run, this script first executes inputs_Schlogl_hist_1d, then executes ../../hist_n.py, which calculates:
  - distribution of cell number density (output: res.hist*) (figure files: hist_semilogy.png and hist_linear.png)
  - mean, variance, probability of negative density, and the KL-divergence (output: res.n_stat)

You can change relevant options by modifying run.sh.


2. stat.sh

For NRUN>1, this script calculates the mean and standard error of each quntity over the runs.
In addition, it also executes stat_plot.py to generate three plots with errorbars: hist_semilog.png, hist_linear.png, and Sk.png


** additional analysis
- face_avg.sh
- sum_Sk.py (execute: cd TEST1; python ../sum_Sk_1d.py; cd ..)
