how to run: first, execute run.sh
            then, execute stat.sh (for NRUN>1)

1. run.sh

This script executes inputs_Schlogl_hist_1d.
If NRUN>1, several runs are performed with different random seeds.
(if USEMPIEXEC=yes, these runs are concurrently performed.)
You can change relevant options by modifying run.sh.

2. stat.sh

For NRUN>1, this scripts calculates the mean and standard error of each quntity over the runs.
