executing run.sh will
1) run reactdiff program with inputs_Schlogl_linearized_eqn_analysis_1d; 
2) generate a plot through gnuplot with Sk.plt.
** you will get a warning that res_theo is not found. see below.

you will need to
1) change the following parameters in Sk.plt accordingly.
  - nb, r, D0 (these values are only problem specific)
  - dt, dx, rm, chi (these values give alpha and beta)
  - you may also want to change yrange, ytics, mytics.
2) provide "res_theo" containing theoretical result.
  - this can be calculated from Mathematica notebook "Schlogl_linearized_eqn_analysis_1d.nb"
