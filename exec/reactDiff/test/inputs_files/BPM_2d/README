This directory contains scripts for generating
- Figures 5, 6, 7 (Section V.B)
in Paper by C. Kim et al. "Stochastic simulation of reaction-diffusion systems:
A fluctuating-hydrodynamics approach" J. Chem. Phys. 146, 124110 (2017).

Scripts are based on inputs file ../inputs_paper_BPM_2d.
Hence, pattern formation of BPM model is investigated. 

** Execution
1. edit run.sh and run it
 - if you do not want plot files, set plot_int = 0
 - if you do not want spatial average densities (fort.9), 
   set n_steps_write_avg = 0
 - you can put a number or "plot"
  ./run.sh -> subdirectory $RUNNAME created (screen output)
  ./run.sh 10 -> subdirectory $RUNNAME_RUN10 created (background run)
  ./run.sh plot -> subdirectory $RUNNAME_plot created (screen output)
 * for job submission to slurm, use slurm_submit.sh
 
2. you can fit the time profile of spatial average of U species (in fort.9)
 - single run: go to subdirectory and "python ../fit.py"
   (n_avg.png and res.fit obtained)
 - multiple run: edit fit.sh and run it
   ($RUNNAME.fit obtained in addition to n_avg.png and res.fit in each subdir)

3. you can also obtain a png file that compares the distribution of fitting 
  parameters for diffrent sets of runs using comp_plot.py
  (for usage: "python comp_plot.py")
