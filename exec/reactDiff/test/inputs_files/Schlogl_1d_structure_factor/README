This directory contains scripts for the numerical confirmation of the structure
factor analysis given in
- Section IV.B
- (see also Appendix C and Appendix A.2)
- (see also Figures 2 and 9)
in Paper by C. Kim et al. "Stochastic simulation of reaction-diffusion
 systems: A fluctuating-hydrodynamics approach" 
 J. Chem. Phys. 146, 124110 (2017).

Scripts are based on inputs file ../inputs_paper_Schlogl_1d_structure_factor.
Hence, the structure factor of the out-of-equilibrium Schlogl model is
computed from a temporal integrator.
To compare the result to the linearized equation analysis, large cross section
(=1000) is used.

** Execution
1. edit run.sh and run it
 -> Sk_xi.py is executed to generate res.Sk_xi from Schlogl1D.S_k.pair=1.Re.dat
 -> res.Sk_xi contains three columns:
  1st=xi (unitless variable corresponding to k; see info_Schlogl_monomodal_1d)
  2st=calculated structure factor Sk(xi)
  3rd=exact structure factor
2. edit Sk.plot and "gnuplot Sk.plot"  
 -> Sk.eps is generated

** Theoretical prediction of Sk(xi) for a scheme
 -> can be obtained from mathematica notebook structure_factor_analysis.nb
 -> some results are in subdirectory theo_data for code validation purpose
