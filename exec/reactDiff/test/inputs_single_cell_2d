!!! check comments starting with "!!!", which are related with this specific case (i.e., single cell).
!!! note that, in this case, there is only reaction; no diffusion, no boundary condition.
!!! so, several parameters are not relevant (i.e., do not affect results)
!!!
!!! by choosing prob_type=0 and initial_variance=0, we can assign the initial values through n_init(1,1:nspecies).
!!! 
!!! instead of generating plot files, you can easily check the number densities through the sreen output.
!!! that is, since there is only one cell, n_avg (average over the cells) is just the number density.
!!! you may want to try the following command to see the number densities and save them to file res: 
!!! ./main.Linux.gfortran.debug.mpi.exe inputs_single_cell_2d | grep n_avg | tee res
