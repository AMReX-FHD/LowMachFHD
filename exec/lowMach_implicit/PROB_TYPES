prob_type controls the initialization of rho, rho*c, p, and m (see init.f90)

prob_type = 0
Initialization: Sets m=0, p=0, c=c_init(1), and sets rho from the EOS.

prob_type = 1
Initialization: Sets m=0 and p=0.  Initializes a low-density spherical bubble .
                transitioning from c_init(1) to c_init(2) and sets rho from 
		the EOS.

prob_type = 2
Initialization: Sets m=0 and p=0.  Initializes a bilayer interface (stripe) 
                controled by c_init(1:2) and sets rho from the EOS.
