prob_type controls the initialization of rho, rho*c, p, and m (see init.f90)
Also, depending on how bc_lo(1:dm) and bc_hi(1:dm) are set in the inputs file,
prob_type controls Dirichlet conditions on boundaries for the primitive 
variables (rho and c) as well as the velocities (see inhomogeneous_bc_val.f90).

prob_type = 0
Initialization: Sets m=0, p=0, c=c_init(1), and sets rho from the EOS.
Physical Boundary Conditions: Can support reservoir boundary conditions with 
                              the concentration value specified by 
			      c_bc(dir,lohi).

prob_type = 1
Initialization: Sets m=0 and p=0.  Initializes a low-density spherical bubble .
                transitioning from c_init(1) to c_init(2) and sets rho from 
		the EOS.
Physical Boundary Conditions: Can support a moving hi-y wall (in 2D) and a
                              moving hi-z wall (in 3D) controlled by 
			      wallspeed_hi(:,:).

prob_type = 2
Initialization: Sets m=0 and p=0.  Initializes a bilayer interface (stripe) 
                controled by c_init(1:2) and sets rho from the EOS.
Physical Boundary Conditions: None coded up yet.
