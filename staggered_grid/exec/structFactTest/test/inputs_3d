  project_dir = 0                       ! Projection direction (1=x, 2=y, 3=z)
  ! Meaning: 0=analyze full grid data only (no projection needed for HydroGrid, 
  !          but still need projection if stats_int>0)
  ! +dim=project along dim then analyze 2D only,
  ! -dim=analyze full grid using HydroGrid and then project along dim so we also analyze projections
  ! It is better to use the conserved variables but it does not quite work for staggered
