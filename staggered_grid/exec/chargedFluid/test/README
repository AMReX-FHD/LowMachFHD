are examples that run by reading in a pnp profile


Supported Problems (./inputs_files/):

----------------------------------
The following inputs files were used to generate results in J-P.Peraud et al.
"Low Mach number fluctuating hydrodanymics for electrolytes", Phys. Rev. Fluids 1, 
074103, (2016)
----------------------------------

inputs_paper_Seawater_convergence

Fig. 1 (a. and b., the line representing the system with charged species). 
A deterministic diffusing stripe of salty water (Na+ and Cl- in water) in 
very dilute water. 

-----------------------------------

inputs_paper_Seawater_structure

Fig. 2. Equilibrium structure factor of a system of seawater (Na+ and Cl- in water)

-----------------------------------

inputs_paper_Seawater_gradient

Fig. 4. Non-equilibrium (i.e. in the presence of gradient) structure factor
of seawater

-----------------------------------

inputs_paper_Seawater_movie_3d

Fig. 5. 3d simulation of the mixing instability. The potential at one of the walls
is set by Epot_wall(2,2) (currently at 2.d9 in cgs units, i.e. 200V)

-----------------------------------

inputs_external_field

Non-equilibrium (in the presence of externally applied electric field) structure
factor of a simple system of electrolytes (both ions with same diffusivities, mass...)
The following structure factors are obtained:
<vx,vx> in file charge.S_k.pair=1.vtk
<vx,vy> in file charge.S_k.pair=2.vtk
<vy,vy> in file charge.S_k.pair=3.vtk
<w1,w1> in file charge.S_k.pair=4.vtk
<w1,w2> in file charge.S_k.pair=5.vtk
<vx,w1> in file charge.S_k.pair=6.vtk
<vx,w2> in file charge.S_k.pair=7.vtk
