- Figure 8 (Section V.C)
in Paper by C. Kim et al. "Stochastic simulation of reaction-diffusion systems:
A fluctuating-hydrodynamics approach" J. Chem. Phys. 146, 124110 (2017).

** in the paper, cross_section = 1000 is used
** but in the current code, cross_section cannot be set independently

Scripts are based on inputs file ../inputs_paper_Lemarchand_3d.
Hence, the front propagation in Lemarchand et al. model is investigated. 

** Execution
1. this calculation is very large and should be run with slurm_submit.sh
2. png files can be generated from scripts in gen_figure
