in Paper by C. Kim et al. "Stochastic simulation of reaction-diffusion systems:
A fluctuating-hydrodynamics approach" J. Chem. Phys. 146, 124110 (2017).

Scripts are based on inputs file ../inputs_paper_equilibrium_1d_hist_schemes.
Hence, equilibrium states of Schlogl reaction-diffusion model generated by
different temporal integrators are investigated. 
Compared to equilibrium_1d_hist_SODEs, the following parameters are fixed:
- nreactions=4 (Schlogl model)
- prob_hi_z=10 (10 molecules per cell)
- avg_type=1 (arithmetic averaging with C0-smoothed Heaviside function)
See run.sh for changeable options.
