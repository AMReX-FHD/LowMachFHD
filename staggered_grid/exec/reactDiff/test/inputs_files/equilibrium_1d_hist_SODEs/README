in Paper by C. Kim et al. "Stochastic simulation of reaction-diffusion systems:
A fluctuating-hydrodynamics approach" J. Chem. Phys. 146, 124110 (2017).

Scripts are based on inputs file ../inputs_paper_equilibrium_1d_hist_SODEs.
Hence, the equilibrium state generated by Schlogl reaction-diffusion model or
diffusion-only case is investigated.
To minimize time integration error (i.e. any dependence on temporal integrator)
or finite system size error, a large system size (512 cells) and a small 
timestep size (dt=10^-3) are used with Euler-Maruyama + Tau-leaping scheme.

For Figure 10 in Appendix B,
- nreactions=0 (diffusion-only)
- prob_hi_z=5 (5 molecules per cell)
- avg_type=10, 1, 11, 12 (Heaviside or smoothed Heaviside functions)

For Figure 3 in Section V.A.1,
- nreactions=4 or 0 (Schlogl or diffusion-only)
- prob_hi_z=10 (10 molecules per cell)
- avg_type=1, 2, or 3 (arithmetic, geometric, harmonic)
