** run **
By executing "run.sh", you can simulate a single cell system several times
 up to a given time with decreasing time step. 

** output **
For each value of dt, the final number densities will be saved in file $RES.
On the screen, you will see
- the command for each run,
- differences in number densities compared between successive runs,
- the ratios between the differences for successive runs.
Note that since dt is decreased by factor of 2, the ratio is close to 2 (or 4),
then the scheme is of first-(or second-)order.
 
** changeable options **
In run.sh, you may change the following things:
- PROG: path for the reactdiff executable
- INPUTS: path for the inputs file
- RES: output filename 
- OPTIONS0: parameter values to be used for deterministic convergence rate test
- OPTIONS: some parameter values to be applied for all runs 
- DT0: largest timestep size (DT will successively decrease by factor of 2)
- MAXSTEP0: max_step for DT0 (MAXSTEP will successively increase by factor of 2)
