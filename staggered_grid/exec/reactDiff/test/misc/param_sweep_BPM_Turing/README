** run **
Basically, you can do parameter sweeping by executing "run.sh",
 where you can choose either the splitting case or the unsplitting case.

** output **
The results on the screen will be saved in "res_split" or "res_unsplit".
For each paramter combination, a directory will be created,
 where resulting plotfiles are located.
The screen output for each run will be save on "res.scr" on this directory.  

** changeable options **
In test_split.sh or test_unsplit.sh, you may change the following things:
- PROG: path for the reactdiff executable
- INPUTS: path for the inputs file
- JOB: short test runs or actual runs
- DIR0: prefix for result directories
- options0: some parameter values to be used for all runs
