** run **
By executing "run.sh", you can run a series of simulations
for a reaction-diffusion system, where Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed
for its initial number densities, with decreasing dx and dt by factor of 2.

** output **
On the screen, you will see
- the options used for each run,
- differences in number densities between successive runs,
- ratios of the differences between successive runs.
Note that, since dt and dx are decreased by factor of 2, if the ratio is close to 2 (or 4),
then the scheme is of first-(or second-)order.
The difference and ratio values will be also saved in file res_diff.
 
** changeable options **
In run.sh, you may change the following things:
- PROG: path for the reactdiff executable
- INPUTS: path for the inputs file
- EXEC_DIFF: executable for calculating the difference between multifabs 
- OPTIONS_DCRT: parameter values to be used for deterministic convergence rate test
- MY_OPTIONS: some parameter values to be applied for all runs 
- NTEST: number of successive runs
Default starting values for n_cells, max_grid_size, fixed_dt, max_step are obtained from
the inputs script. But, if you want to change some of these, you can do so by giving values.

** decreasing only either dt or dx
If you want to decrease only dt with dx fixed, comment out the lines updating NX, NY, MGSX, MGSY.
Similarly, by commenting out the lines updating DT and MAXSTEP, you can decrease only dx, while dt is fixed.
