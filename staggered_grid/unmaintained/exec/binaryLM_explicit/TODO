========================
Algorithmic Fixes
========================
-At slip walls, do NOT use dv_t/dn=0, but rather eta*(dv_t/dn + dv_n/dt)=0.
 Note that for zero normal velocity nothing changes --> dv_t/dn=0.
 We should set the viscous fluxes at nodes and edges on the boundary
 to zero, instead of using ghost values.

========================
Code improvement
========================
-Staggered multigrid solver physical boundary condition support.

========================
Optional / less critical stuff
========================
-(Maybe?) In the present version of mkaofs_s, it is not even necessary to keep 
   arrays fluxx, fluxy etc, since those are trivial to calculate and one 
   can just directly do the divergence of the flux. Better and more flexible 
   would be to have the fluxes be edge-based multifabs that are incremented 
   by each routine and the divergence is calculated at the end.
   
-Implement boyce_bc no-slip wall tapering at all walls (it is only
   implemented at the hi-y boundary in 2D and the hi-z and hi-y boundaries in 3D).

========================
Major future work
========================
-applyop_stag needs to work for dx != dy != dz
